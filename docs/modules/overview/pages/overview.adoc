== Purpose

*RacksDB* is an _open source_ solution to modelize your datacenters
infrastructures. It provides a simple database schema to store information about
the equipments in your datacenters, with tools and library to request this
database. This database can be used as *reference source* for many purposes in
IT management.

* **Inventory**: Get permanent reference list of equipments charactistics and
  enable conformity testing.
* **Automation**: Adopt Infrastructure-as-Code by coupling generic configuration
  management logic with infrastructures model.
* **Continuous deployment**: Define advanced deployment rules based on nodes
  characteristics declared in RacksDB.
* **Monitoring**: Synchronize monitoring services with equipments database and
  define dynamic dashboard.
* **Documentation**: Get updated architecture diagrams and define generic
  adaptative procedures.

== Characteristics

The main characteristics of *RacksDB* are the following:

* **YAML based.** The data are stored in plain files using human-readable YAML
  format, easily managed with Git.
* **Simple and pragmatic.** The database schema is intuitive and practical,
  infrastructures can be described in few minutes.
* **Tag-based.** Easy filtering of data and equipments based on associated tags.
* **Decentralized architecture.** RacksDB can be deployed without central
  server, just by replicating few plain YAML files.
* **Extensibility.** In addition to RacksDB simple format, custom schema
  extensions can be defined to store specific data.

== Interfaces

Once the database is defined, data can be searched and extracted using the
xref:usage:racksdb.adoc[`racksdb` CLI]. A xref:usage:ui.adoc[Web UI] is also
available to explore its content.

For full integration with your software, a xref:usage:lib.adoc[Python library]
and a xref:usage:rest.adoc[REST API] can also be used to stay continuously
synchronized with database content.
