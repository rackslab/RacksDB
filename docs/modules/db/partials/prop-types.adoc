== Objects Definitions

Objects definitions are mappings with the following expected keys:

`description` _(optional)_:: String to describe the purpose of the object.

`properties`:: Mapping of objects properties. The keys are the names of the
properties. The values are mapping with the following expected keys:

`type`::: The xref:#type[property type], as described below.

`description`::: String to describe the purpose and content of the property.

`key` _(optional)_::: Boolean to determine if the property is a
xref:concepts.adoc#key[key]. Default value is _false_.

`default` _(optional)_::: Default value of the property. When the `type` is an
xref:concepts.adoc#object[object], the special value `:recursive` can be used to
make the default value of the property the corresponding object with all its
defaults properties, recursively.

`example` _(optional)_::: Example value of the property.

`optional` _(optional)_::: Boolean to determine if property is optional.
Default value is _false_.

== Properties Type

The xref:concepts.adoc#types[properties types] are expressed with the following
notation:

* xref:concepts.adoc#native[native types] are expressed by their name +
  _ex:_ _str_ or _int_
* xref:concepts.adoc#object [objects] are prefixed by `:` +
  _ex:_ `:DatacenterRoomDimensions`
* xref:concepts.adoc#sequence[sequences] (or lists) are noted `list[<content>]` +
  _ex:_ `list[str]` or `list[:Infrastructure]`
* xref:concepts.adoc#reference[reference to other objects properties] are
  prefixed by `$` +
  _ex:_ `$NodeType.id`
* xref:concepts.adoc#backref[back references] to a parent objects or one of
  their properties are prefixed by `^` +
  _ex:_ `^Datacenter` or `^InfrastructurePart.rack`
* xref:structure.adoc#deftypes[defined types] are prefixed by `~` +
  _ex:_ `~dimension`
