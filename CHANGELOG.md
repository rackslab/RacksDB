### Changed
- schema:
  - Rename objects:
    - `DatacenterRoomRack` → `Rack`
    - `DatacenterRoomRow` → `RacksRow`
    - `DatacenterRoomPosition` → `RacksRowPosition`
- core:
  - Introduce DBDict objects that inherit from standard Python dict to handle
    list of objects with keys (#15).
  - New schema format with properties specifications as mapping/hash
  - Schema dumps are now the raw data loaded in schema YAML files and defined
    types instead of an interpreted output.
- lib:
  - RacksDB.nodes and RacksDBInfrastructure.nodes attributes are now DBDict
    of unexpanded nodes.
  - Store datacenters, infrastructures and nodes tags in DBList objects.

  - Present the supported Linux distributions with tabs in the quickstart
    guide.
  - Mention key attribute on {Network,Storage}Equipment.name property in
    structure reference.

    changes on `DBList` class.
  - Load of extension example due to missing rack type.
  - Update quickstart guide to mention Python library and REST API.
  - Update schema and extensions pages to document new schema file format.
